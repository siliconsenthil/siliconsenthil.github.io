    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had a requirement in our app to ignore few validations by just showing warnings to user and continuing the object to save.
The gem <a href="https://github.com/gtd/validation_scopes"><em>validation_scopes</em></a> seemed to be a right choice and we used it.</p>

<p>We faced memory issues and <a href="/blog/2013/01/19/how-we-debugged-rails-memory-leak/">figured out</a>
<code>model.has_warnings?</code> of <em>validation_scopes</em> was causing issue.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Let's take a rails model class <em>Employee</em>
``` ruby
class Employee &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :address, :age, :name
  validates_presence_of :name
  validation_scope :warnings do |s|</p>

<pre><code>s.validates_presence_of :address
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p><code>
1.9.3p194 :001 &gt; e = Employee.new(:name =&gt; 'Senthil V S')
 =&gt; #&lt;Employee id: nil, name: "Senthil V S", age: nil, address: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil&gt;
1.9.3p194 :002 &gt; e.valid?
 =&gt; true
1.9.3p194 :003 &gt; e.instance_variables
 =&gt; [:@attributes, :@association_cache, :@aggregation_cache, :@attributes_cache,
 :@new_record, :@readonly, :@destroyed, :@marked_for_destruction, :@previously_changed,
 :@changed_attributes, :@mass_assignment_options, :@validation_context, :@errors]
</code></p>

<p>No problem till now. Now I call <code>has_warnings?</code> on this object.
<code>
1.9.3p194 :004 &gt; e.has_warnings?
 =&gt; true
1.9.3p194 :005 &gt; e.instance_variables
 =&gt; [:@attributes, :@association_cache, :@aggregation_cache, :@attributes_cache,
 :@new_record, :@readonly, :@destroyed, :@marked_for_destruction, :@previously_changed,
 :@changed_attributes, :@mass_assignment_options, :@validation_context, :@errors, :@warnings]
</code></p>

<p>Notice a new instance variable(<code>@warnings</code>)gets set. Let's see what it has.</p>

<p><code>
1.9.3p194 :034 &gt; warning_object = e.instance_variable_get :@warnings
 =&gt; #&lt;Employee id: nil, name: "Senthil V S", age: nil, address: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil&gt;
1.9.3p194 :035 &gt; warning_object.class
 =&gt; #&lt;Class:0x007ffeddb0c1e0&gt;
1.9.3p194 :036 &gt; warning_object.class.ancestors
 =&gt; [#&lt;Class:0x007ffeddb0c1e0&gt;, ActiveModel::Validations::HelperMethods,
 ActiveModel::Validations, ActiveSupport::Callbacks, #&lt;Class:0x007ffeddba5f70&gt;,
 Delegator, #&lt;Module:0x007ffedcb35eb0&gt;, BasicObject]  
1.9.3p194 :037 &gt; warning_object.__getobj__ == e
 =&gt; true
</code></p>

<p>What <code>@warnings</code>  has is an object of class defined during runtime by <em>DelegatorClass</em> .
The problem is that these runtime created classes don't get garbage collected.</p>

<p><code>
1.9.3p194 :007 &gt; warning_object_class_id = warning_object.class.object_id
 =&gt; 70366308884720
1.9.3p194 :008 &gt; e_object_id = e.object_id
 =&gt; 70366307844540
</code></p>

<p>We've taken the <em>object_id</em> of the model object and runtime created delegator class(which is an instance of class <em>Class</em> of course). Let's set the references to nil and run the GC.</p>

<p><code>
1.9.3p194 :014 &gt; local_variables
 =&gt; [:e_object_id, :warning_object_class_id, :warning_object, :e, :_]
 1.9.3p194 :009 &gt; warning_object = e = nil
 =&gt; nil
1.9.3p194 :010 &gt; GC.start
 =&gt; nil
</code></p>

<p>Now let's use those object_ids to check whether they get GCed.</p>

<p>```
1.9.3p194 :011 > ObjectSpace._id2ref e_object_id
RangeError: 0x003fff6ec881bc is recycled object</p>

<pre><code>from (irb):11:in `_id2ref'
from (irb):11
from /Users/senthilvs/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194@global/gems/railties-3.2.10/lib/rails/commands/console.rb:47:in `start'
from /Users/senthilvs/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194@global/gems/railties-3.2.10/lib/rails/commands/console.rb:8:in `start'
from /Users/senthilvs/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194@global/gems/railties-3.2.10/lib/rails/commands.rb:41:in `&lt;top (required)&gt;'
from script/rails:6:in `require'
from script/rails:6:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>1.9.3p194 :012 > ObjectSpace._id2ref warning_object_class_id
 => #&lt;Class:0x007ffeddb0c1e0>
```</p>

<p>So, the runtime created anonymous classes never get GCed and stay in memory. This the reason why
the memory was kept on increasing for every request.</p>

<p>We fixed it by replacing <em>validation_scopes</em> with <a href="https://github.com/paneq/activemodel-warnings"><em>activemodel-warnings</em></a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We run our app on heroku and kept on getting <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/error-codes#r14-memory-quota-exceeded">R14</a>s. Our google and stackoverflow skills did provide
few suggestions and but din't help much. We used few tools (<a href="https://github.com/brynary/rack-bug">rack_bug</a>, <a href="https://github.com/noahd1/oink">oink</a>) see the memory usage. They provided who use how much <br/>
but we could make further progress with that. So here's what we did to find out.</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>Figured out what pages create R14

<ul>
<li>Observe pattern of usage</li>
<li>Load test app with multiple usage paths. Figure out which falls soon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>This is more of finding usage patterns and making guesses. We should ascertain our guess with heavily loading the suspected page(s) and see the memory pattern. We had a page that was most frequently used. We hit it with jmeter and within in minutes it ended up with R14.</p>


<ul>
<li>Replicated the leak in local machine.

<ul>
<li>Ran the app in production environment and kept hitting the page.</li>
<li>Used <code>vmmap</code> to find out memory usage pattern. (You can use <em>smap</em> or <em>pmap</em> as well.)</li>
<li>Saw the memory usage keep on increasing and never getting stabilized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p> When we start the rails app and start visiting pages, the memory goes up. It increases to certain extent and gets stable after
a while. Don't be misguided by the initial increase in memory as memory leak. It happens for all the pages. But, it gets stable soon. For leaking pages, the memory never gets stabilized.
</p>


<ul>
<li>Drilled down and found the code that leaks.

<ul>
<li>Removed the action and view code and rendered the page and saw memory was stable. This is to ensure
the problem is with the specific page and not the framework as such.</li>
<li>Added code step-by-step in chunks and observed memory usage.</li>
<li>Figured out which chunk leaks the memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><span> Finally, nailed down to <code>model.has_warnings?</code>.</span>
We use <a href="https://github.com/gtd/validation_scopes">validation_scopes</a> which was the cause in our case. It was creating metaclasses for validation
and those classes did not get garbage collected (<a href="/blog/2013/01/19/validation-scopes-leaks-memory/">details</a>).</p>

<p>We fixed it by replacing <em>validation_scopes</em> with <a href="https://github.com/paneq/activemodel-warnings"><em>activemodel-warnings</em></a>.</p>

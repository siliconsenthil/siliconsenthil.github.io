All was going on well.
Despite this coverage, we saw our code breaking in production due to small chages in request xml body. We wanted our integration spec to cover these too. By default, vcr matches request method and url. We wanted it to match the post body too. Simple match by body does not solve as it does plain string match.</description></item></channel></rss>
